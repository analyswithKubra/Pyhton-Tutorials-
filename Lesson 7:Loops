Understanding Loops in Python 🚀
Loops in Python allow us to repeat actions multiple times without writing the same code over and over again.

There are two main types of loops in Python:

For Loop → Used when you know how many times you need to repeat something.
While Loop → Used when you don’t know how many times but repeat until a condition is met.


1️⃣ For Loop Explanation
A for loop repeats a task for each item in a group (like a list, range, or string).

💡 Think of it like this:
👉 "For every toy in the toy box, play with it!"

Example 
for number in range(1, 6):  # Start at 1, stop at 6 (6 is not included)
    print("Number:", number)



2️⃣ While Loop Explanation
A while loop repeats a task as long as a condition is True.

💡 Think of it like this:
👉 "Keep playing with the toy until mom says stop!"

Example 
number = 5  # Start at 5

while number >= 1:  # Repeat while number is 1 or more
    print("Number:", number)
    number -= 1  # Decrease number by 1
