What is a String?

ðŸ“Œ A string in Python is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes ("Hello" or 'Python'). It can contain letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces.

What are Python String Methods & Why Do We Need Them?
ðŸ“Œ  Python has 47 built-in string methods that help modify and analyze text easily. They allow us to change case, remove spaces, replace words, split text, and search within strings.
We need them to process text efficiently without writing complex code, making tasks like formatting, searching, and cleaning text simpler.String methods can also be combined to create more powerful and flexible operations, allowing advanced text manipulation with minimal effort. ðŸš€


1. `.lower()`  â†’ Converts text to lowercase  
   Example: `"HELLO".lower()` â†’ `"hello"`  
2. `.upper()`  â†’ Converts text to uppercase  
   Example: `"hello".upper()` â†’ `"HELLO"`  
3. `.strip()`  â†’ Removes spaces from both sides  
   Example: `" hello ".strip()` â†’ `"hello"`  
4. `.replace("old", "new")`  â†’ Replaces part of a string  
   Example: `"apple".replace("a", "o")` â†’ `"opple"`  
5. `.split(",")`  â†’ Splits a string into a list  
   Example: `"a,b,c".split(",")` â†’ `["a", "b", "c"]`
