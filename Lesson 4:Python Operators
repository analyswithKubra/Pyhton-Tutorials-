1.Arithmetic OperatorsüßÆ
These operators perform basic mathematical operations.


# Addition
x = 5 + 3  
print(x)  # Output: 8

# Subtraction
x = 5 - 3  
print(x)  # Output: 2

# Multiplication
x = 5 * 3  
print(x)  # Output: 15

# Division (returns a float)
x = 5 / 2  
print(x)  # Output: 2.5

# Floor Division (divides and rounds down)
x = 5 // 2  
print(x)  # Output: 2

# Modulus (returns the remainder)
x = 5 % 2  
print(x)  # Output: 1

# Exponentiation (power)
x = 5 ** 2  
print(x)  # Output: 25



2. Comparison Operators üîç
These operators compare values and return True or False.


# Addition
x = 5 + 3  
print(x)  # Output: 8

# Subtraction
x = 5 - 3  
print(x)  # Output: 2

# Multiplication
x = 5 * 3  
print(x)  # Output: 15

# Division (returns a float)
x = 5 / 2  
print(x)  # Output: 2.5

# Floor Division (divides and rounds down)
x = 5 // 2  
print(x)  # Output: 2

# Modulus (returns the remainder)
x = 5 % 2  
print(x)  # Output: 1

# Exponentiation (power)
x = 5 ** 2  
print(x)  # Output: 25





3. Assignment Operators üéØ
These operators assign values and update variables.

# Assign value
x = 5  
print(x)  # Output: 5

# Add and assign
x = 5  
x += 3  # Same as x = x + 3
print(x)  # Output: 8

# Subtract and assign
x = 5  
x -= 3  # Same as x = x - 3
print(x)  # Output: 2

# Multiply and assign
x = 5  
x *= 3  # Same as x = x * 3
print(x)  # Output: 15

# Divide and assign
x = 5  
x /= 2  # Same as x = x / 2
print(x)  # Output: 2.5

# Floor divide and assign
x = 5  
x //= 2  # Same as x = x // 2
print(x)  # Output: 2

# Modulus and assign
x = 5  
x %= 2  # Same as x = x % 2
print(x)  # Output: 1

# Exponentiate and assign
x = 5  
x **= 2  # Same as x = x ** 2
print(x)  # Output: 25
