What is a Module in Python? 🚀
A module in Python is a file that contains Python code (functions, variables, or classes) that we can import and reuse in other programs.

💡 Think of a module as a toolbox 🧰—instead of writing the same code repeatedly, you can import a module and use its ready-made functions!

📌 Types of Modules in Python
There are three types of modules:

1️⃣ Built-in Modules (Already in Python)
These are modules that come with Python—no need to install them.

Module	What It Does?
math=Performs mathematical operations like square root and trigonometry
random=Generates random numbers and choices
datetime=Works with dates and times
os=Interacts with the operating system (files, folders)
sys=Provides system-related functions (e.g., exit the program)

📌 Example Using a Built-in Module (math)


import math
print(math.sqrt(25))  # Output: 5.0


2️⃣ External Modules (Downloaded with pip)
Some modules are not built-in, so you need to install them before using them.

numpy=Used for numerical computing (arrays, matrices)
pandas=Used for data analysis and handling datasets
matplotlib=Used for data visualization (graphs, charts)
requests=Used for making HTTP requests (API calls)

📌 Example Using an External Module (numpy)


import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
print(arr * 2)  # Multiply all numbers by 2

✅ You need to install it first using:
pip install numpy


3️⃣ Custom Modules (Your Own .py Files)
You can create your own module by saving Python functions in a file and importing it into another program.

📌 Example of Creating a Custom Module (greetings.py)

Create a Python file (greetings.py) and add a function:

# greetings.py (Your Custom Module)
def say_hello(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

Import and use it in another file (main.py):
import greetings
print(greetings.say_hello("Alice"))
✅ Now you can reuse say_hello() anywhere! 🎉


📌 How to Create a Custom Module in Google Colab?
Since Colab doesn’t have files like a local computer, you can use %%writefile to create a module.

1️⃣ Create a Module (hero.py)


%%writefile hero.py

def superhero_name(name):
    return f"The Mighty {name}!"
2️⃣ Import and Use It


import hero
print(hero.superhero_name("Alice"))
✅ Works like a regular module! 🚀



📌 Summary of Modules
Type of Module	Example	Why Use It?
Built-in Modules	math, random, datetime	Already included in Python
External Modules	numpy, pandas, matplotlib	Need to install with pip
Custom Modules	Your own .py file	Organize and reuse your own code


🎯 Final Thoughts
✅ Modules help us reuse code instead of writing everything from scratch.
✅ Python has built-in modules, but you can also install external ones or create your own.
✅ In Google Colab, use %%writefile to create and import custom modules.
